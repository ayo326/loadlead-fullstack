# Admin Console Build-out — Progress

Living checklist for the multi-phase rebuild of `admin.loadleadapp.com`.
Resume from the first NOT STARTED item. See task brief in the original
prompt for the full execution protocol.

| # | Phase | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Internal `/login` revamp + platform-staff roles | DONE |
| 2 | Live fleet feed (telematics-gated) | DONE |
| 3 | Email support inbox (Resend inbound + outbound; SLA) | DONE |
| 4 | Chat + phone via third-party embeds | NOT STARTED |
| 5 | Independence + a11y pass | NOT STARTED |

## Phase 1 — Internal /login + platform-staff roles
**Status:** DONE
**Files touched:**
- `backend/src/types/platformRole.ts` — NEW. `PlatformRole` enum (STAFF_ADMIN | STAFF_MANAGER | STAFF_SUPERVISOR | STAFF_TEAM_LEAD), tier matrices (DESTRUCTIVE_TIER, OPS_TIER, READ_TIER), back-compat resolver. Different module + different TS type than `OrgRole`.
- `backend/src/types/index.ts` — added optional `platformRole?: string` to User.
- `backend/src/middleware/auth.ts` — `requireStaffTier(...allowed)` middleware. Fresh DB read of the user (NOT the JWT) so tier changes take effect on the next request, not the next token refresh.
- `backend/src/routes/admin.ts` — `requireStaffTier(...DESTRUCTIVE_TIER)` on `/orgs/:id/suspend`, `/orgs/:id/reinstate`, `/users/:id/revoke-admin`. Read-only routes stay on `requireAdmin` only (all four tiers can read).
- `backend/scripts/setPlatformRole.mjs` — NEW CLI to set / change tier on an existing ADMIN user. Idempotent.
- `backend/tests/unit/iam/platformRole.test.ts` — NEW (15/15 pass): (a) PlatformRole values namespaced with `STAFF_`; (b) STAFF_MANAGER/SUPERVISOR/TEAM_LEAD all 403 on the three destructive routes; (c) STAFF_ADMIN passes; (d) legacy admin row with no `platformRole` resolves to STAFF_ADMIN (back-compat).
- `frontend-v2/src/pages/admin/AdminLogin.tsx` — NEW. Internal-only sign-in: env badge (PROD/STAGING/DEV), authorized-use notice, IP-restricted note, neutral palette, no signup, no marketing. Generic error copy ("Sign-in failed") so wrong-email vs wrong-password are indistinguishable. Lockout message for 429. Clear MFA challenge screen with one-time-code field.
- `frontend-v2/src/admin-main.tsx` — swapped customer `Login` for `AdminLogin` at the `/login` route in the admin bundle.

**Acceptance / proof (all green):**
- 15/15 platformRole tests pass.
- Admin bundle (`dist-admin/admin-*.js`) contains `"Internal use only"` and `"LoadLead Platform Operations"` and does NOT contain `"Join the network"` or `"owner operator portal"` — verified via grep on the built artefact.
- `PlatformRole` is in its own module (`types/platformRole.ts`); `OrgRole.MANAGER === "MANAGER"` ≠ `PlatformRole.STAFF_MANAGER === "STAFF_MANAGER"`.
- All four staff roles can sign in (`/api/auth/login` 2FA gate covers everyone with role=ADMIN); only STAFF_ADMIN tier passes destructive routes.

**Ops follow-ups for the user (not blocking):**
- Once deployed, run `node backend/scripts/setPlatformRole.mjs --email <admin email> --tier <STAFF_*>` against each of the 4 existing ADMIN rows to assign explicit tiers. Until then they all back-compat to STAFF_ADMIN, which preserves current behaviour.

## Phase 2 — Live fleet feed
**Status:** DONE
**Files touched:**
- `backend/src/services/telematics.ts` — NEW. `getTelematicsStatus()` reads `TELEMATICS_PROVIDER` env. Empty/unset = `{ connected: false, provider: null }`. Any value = `{ connected: true, provider }`. No third state, no fakes.
- `backend/src/routes/admin.ts` — NEW endpoints `GET /api/admin/fleet/feed` and `GET /api/admin/fleet/drivers/:driverId`. Feed assembles drivers across every `DriverStatus` bucket; drawer joins User row for IDV + email/phone and looks up the current load when assigned. Positions surface with `source: 'driver-app'` (NEVER `'live'` or `'telematics'`); drivers with no coords get `position: null`.
- `backend/tests/unit/iam/fleetFeed.test.ts` — NEW (7/7 pass): no-fabrication invariants, env-gated telematics flag, status bucket counts, drawer 404, drawer joins IDV/load.
- `frontend-v2/src/lib/api.ts` — added `adminFleetFeed()` + `adminFleetDriver()`.
- `frontend-v2/src/components/admin/FleetFeed.tsx` — NEW. Driver table grouped by status with colour buckets, status pills, row click opens drawer. Top banner shows live-tracking pill: "Live tracking · samsara" when connected, "Live tracking not connected" + explanatory caption otherwise. Drivers without coords render "No location yet" in muted text.
- `frontend-v2/src/components/admin/FleetFeed.tsx` (DriverDrawer) — right-side dialog showing profile, IDV badge, last-known position (with explicit "not a telematics fix" note when applicable), current load, and disabled Flag / Open ticket quick actions (placeholders pending Phase 3 inbox).
- `frontend-v2/src/pages/admin/AdminDashboard.tsx` — mounted FleetFeed above the OrgManagementPanel.

**Acceptance / proof (all green):**
- 7/7 fleet-feed tests pass. The two no-fabrication assertions ("no coords → position null" and "real coords → source NEVER claims telematics") are explicit.
- `TELEMATICS_PROVIDER` unset → `liveTracking.connected = false`; UI shows the "not connected" pill and the muted explanatory caption.
- Drawer joins IDV (from User row), email/phone, current load (when assigned), and gracefully shows "No location reported yet" when the driver has no heartbeat.
- Admin bundle now 485 KB / 150 KB gzipped.

## Phase 3 — Email support inbox
**Status:** DONE
**Files touched:**
- `backend/src/types/support.ts` — types: `SupportTicket`, `SupportMessage`, `SupportSettings`, `TicketStatus`, `TicketPriority`, `SLAState`.
- `backend/src/services/sla.ts` — pure `computeSlaState()` (RESOLVED / ON_TRACK / DUE_SOON / BREACHED) + `aggregateMonitor()` (% within SLA, avg resolution, breaching count over a 30-day window).
- `backend/src/services/supportTicket.ts` — ticket + message persistence, settings singleton, threading resolver (plus-token / In-Reply-To / References), atomic inbound-id dedupe via Dynamo conditional put.
- `backend/src/services/resendInbound.ts` — Svix-style HMAC-SHA256 signature verification with timestamp tolerance + constant-time compare. Refuses missing secret hard.
- `backend/src/services/integrations/email.ts` — added `sendRawEmail()` for replies with arbitrary headers (Message-ID / In-Reply-To / References pass through).
- `backend/src/services/emailService.ts` — added `sendRawSupportReply()` wrapper.
- `backend/src/routes/support.ts` — NEW. Mounts the public `/inbound` webhook (no auth) and the staff API behind `authenticate + requireAdmin`. `PUT /settings` additionally `requireStaffTier(...DESTRUCTIVE_TIER)`.
- `backend/src/index.ts` — mounted at `/api/support`.
- `backend/tests/unit/iam/supportInbox.test.ts` — 11/11 pass.
- `frontend-v2/src/lib/api.ts` — added 7 support helpers.
- `frontend-v2/src/components/admin/SupportInbox.tsx` — NEW. Inbox list with status filter pills, SLA pills (on-track / due-soon / breached), monitor strip (open, breaching, % within SLA, avg resolution). Detail panel with thread, status + priority selectors, reply composer.
- `frontend-v2/src/pages/admin/AdminDashboard.tsx` — mounted SupportInbox above FleetFeed.

**Tables provisioned in prod:** `LoadLead_SupportTickets`, `LoadLead_SupportMessages`, `LoadLead_SupportSettings`, `LoadLead_SupportInbound`.

**Acceptance / proof (all green):**
- 11/11 tests pass. Coverage:
  - Signed payload → OPEN ticket.
  - Same payload twice → returned `duplicate`, no second ticket (DynamoDB conditional put).
  - In-Reply-To matching prior Message-ID → same ticket.
  - Bad signature → 400 `bad-signature`.
  - Missing `RESEND_WEBHOOK_SECRET` → 400 `missing-secret` (refuses to process unsigned mail).
  - Stale timestamp > 5 min → 400 `stale-timestamp` (replay defence).
  - Inbound on a SOLVED ticket → status reopens to OPEN, `resolvedAt` cleared.
  - Staff reply → Resend send called with `In-Reply-To`, `References`, `Message-ID`; ticket gets `firstResponseAt`; subject prefixed `Re: `.
  - PATCH status=SOLVED stamps `resolvedAt`; status back to OPEN clears it.
  - `aggregateMonitor` over a mixed resolved set computes the correct `% within SLA`.

**Live ops state (this is what's deployed):**
- Inbound: Amazon SES, not Resend. Resend free plan only supports root-domain receiving which would clobber the existing Google Workspace MX on loadleadapp.com.
- Receiving domain: `inbound.loadleadapp.com` (DKIM verified Jun 23 2026).
- Receiving address: `support@inbound.loadleadapp.com`.
- SES Receipt Rule: `loadlead-rules / forward-to-sns` -> SNS Encoding=Base64.
- SNS topic: `arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:552011299815:loadlead-support-inbound`, one confirmed HTTPS subscription at `https://api.loadleadapp.com/api/support/inbound/ses`.
- Outbound: Resend (existing send adapter); From = `support@inbound.loadleadapp.com` (verified for sending on the same SES domain). Reply Message-IDs are `<id@support.loadleadapp.com>` so customer email clients thread the conversation correctly.
- Two new EB env vars set in prod: `SUPPORT_FROM_ADDRESS`.
- The `/api/support/inbound` (Resend) endpoint stays in code as a dormant alternative; activates if `RESEND_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is set later.

**End-to-end smoke test passed in prod (Jun 23 2026):**
- ayodeji.ejidiran@gmail.com -> support@inbound.loadleadapp.com ("Real-test 1" / "hello from real test") -> created OPEN ticket.
- Staff reply ("testing") sent and arrived in the Gmail inbox, with our generated Message-ID `<…@support.loadleadapp.com>` so subsequent customer replies thread correctly.

**SES sandbox note:** account is in SES sandbox. Resend sends the outbound replies (not SES), so sandbox doesn't block them. If we ever migrate outbound to SES too, we'll request SES production access.

## Phase 4 — Chat + phone embeds
**Status:** NOT STARTED → next on resume.
**Next step on resume:** thin `services/integrations/support.ts` adapter interface (`chatProvider`, `phoneProvider`), env-driven vendor wiring (Intercom / Crisp for chat, Twilio / Aircall for click-to-call), unconfigured "not connected" pill state. NEVER fake the embed when keys missing.

## Phase 5 — Independence + a11y
**Status:** NOT STARTED
**Next step on resume:** grep for shared parameterized containers; axe-core run; WCAG AA fixes.
